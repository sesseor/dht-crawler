# dht-crawler
Python code implements a crawler for the Distributed Hash Table (DHT) used in BitTorrent networks.

you can use this code snippet to get peers for a torrent you are looking for using only the infohash 

you need to install the `bencodepy` module using `pip install bencode.py`

ik this is a messy code thats why i am working on another and a better one   

this code does not garantee any of the peers to be online or even if they still have the torrent seeded
